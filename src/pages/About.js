        Hello, I am originally from England but moved to Toronto at the end of
        2022. I love exploring new technologies and learning different ways to
        create things. Just recently, I wanted to learn Tailwind CSS, to do
        that, I used it to create this portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me in nature, travelling, building
        keyboards and computers, or eating great food. I am passionate about
        many things, but particularly the intersection of technology and
        society, and how we can use technology to make the world a better place.
        I am excited to create things that follow this ethos.
      </p>
